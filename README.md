# ADV360-PRO-ZMK

An Advantage 360 Pro Dvorak layout matching the Advantage2 Dvorak layout with the following changes:

* Up and down keys are swapped because I always felt that the up arrow was lower than the down arrow and just couldn't get used to it.
* The macro-3 button is multimedia mute/unmute and macro-4 is play/pause.
* I tried to make pressing both FN keys latch the function keys on but it isn't working yet.
* Since it varies from the default Advantage2 layout, the right side keys top to bottom are backslash/pipe, forward slash/question mark, dash/underscore. This is closer to a Dvorak layout on a traditional keyboard where the dash is next to S and the forward slash is next to L.
* PrintScreen and ScrollLock are on the kp layer, top right corner key and the one below it, respectively.

## Modifying the keymap

There is a GUI for editing the keymap. It is available at https://kinesiscorporation.github.io/Adv360-Pro-GUI

## Building the Firmware with GitHub Actions

### Setup

1. Fork this repo.
2. Enable GitHub Actions on your fork.

### Build firmware

1. Push a commit to trigger the build.
2. Download the artifact.

## Building the Firmware in a local container

### Setup

#### Software

* Either Podman or Docker is required, Podman is preferred if both are present.
* Make is also required

#### Windows specific

* If compiling on Windows use WSL2 and Docker [Docker Setup Guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/).
* Install make using `sudo apt-get install make`.
* The repository can be cloned directly into the WSL2 instance or accessed through the C: mount point WSL provides by default (`/mnt/c/path-to-repo`).

### Build firmware

1. Execute `make`.
2. Check the `firmware` directory for the latest firmware build.

### Cleanup

The built docker container and compiled firmware files can be deleted with `make clean`.

## Flashing firmware

Follow the programming instruction on page 8 of the [Quick Start Guide](https://kinesis-ergo.com/wp-content/uploads/Advantage360-Professional-QSG-v8-25-22.pdf) to flash the firmware.

### briefly

1. Extract the firmwares from the downloaded archive.
1. Connect the left side keyboard to USB.
1. Press Mod+macro1 to put the left side into bootloader mode; it should attach to your computer as a USB drive.
1. Copy `left.uf2` to the USB drive and it will disconnect.
1. Power off both keyboards (by unplugging them and making sure the switches are off).
1. Turn on the left side keyboard with the switch.
1. Connect the right side keyboard to USB to power it on.
1. Press Mod+macro3 to put the right side into bootloader mode to attach it as a USB drive.
1. Copy `right.uf2` to the mounted drive.
1. Unplug the right side keyboard and turn it back on.
1. Enjoy!

> Note: There are also physical reset buttons on both keyboards which can be used to enter and exit the bootloader mode. Their location is described in section 2.7 on page 9 in the [User Manual](https://kinesis-ergo.com/wp-content/uploads/Advantage360-ZMK-KB360-PRO-Users-Manual-v3-10-23.pdf) and use is described in section 5.9 on page 14.
